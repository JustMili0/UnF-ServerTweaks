## 1.1.3+mc1.21.11 Changelog

### ***CONFIG***
- Switched to using SuperMartijn642's Config Lib (It is now a dependency)
- You can now disable any command in the mod within the config

### ***DEV STUFF***
- Mod now also works in singleplayer for people that want things like `/afk`, `/damagetoggle`, `/scale` and everything else in survival
- Renamed method `CommandUtil.failCheck` to `CommandUtil.checkIfPlayerExecuted`
- Changed method `CommandUtil.checkIfPlayerExecuted` to use `CommandContext<CommandSourceStack> context` instead of `CommandSourceStack source`
- Fixed error notification from `CommandUtil.checkIfPlayerExecuted(context)` to display executed command in message instead of command source
- Added indicators for commands with outputs, now displaying from what mod the command is
- Method `Afk.despawnNearbyMonsters` no longer depends on ServerLevel. It just gets it from the player instead.
- Created methods `PlayerAttachments.createValue` and `PlayerAttachments.createPersistentValue`
  - `createPersistentValue` values will not be cleared after server/game restart [UNFINISHED]
  - `createValue` values will be cleared after server/game restart
