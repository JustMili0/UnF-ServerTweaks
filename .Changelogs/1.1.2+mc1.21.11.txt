## 1.1.2+mc1.21.11 Changelog
-# 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 were skipped as they were debug and wip versions

### ***CONFIGURATION***
- The mod now has a config file!

### ***NEW CONTENT***
- Uncapped speed limits of players, vehicles and players on elytras.
  - No more "Player moved too fast!" warn and hold-back
  - You can disable/enable specific limiters in config. Only Elytra limit is disabled by default
- Added `/afk` command
  - Utilizes Teams to give the player a `[AFK] ` name prefix
  - Makes the afk player invulnerable, but also player can not damage anything nor move in any way when AFK
  - When coming out of AFK, if it's night, all instances of Monster entities will be despawned (BEHAVIOR CAN BE TURMED OFF IN CONFIG) [WIP]
    - Command has a 5min (6000 ticks) cooldown (TIME CAN BE CHANGED IN CONFIG)

### ***CHANGED CONTENT***
- Reworked `/scaleme` command, now named `/scale`
  - Normal players can still use `/st-scale <height_cm>`
  - Admins now have scaling tools:
    - `/scale force <player> <height_cm>` - Forces specific scale on a player.
    - `/scale unlock <player>` - Unlocks `Scale Lock` allowing the player to change their scale again.
    - `/scale reset <player>` - Resets the player's scale to the base scale and unlocks `Scale Lock`
    - `/scale reset-nounlock <player>` - Resets the player's scale to the base scale without unlocking the `Scale Lock`
  - Commands `/scaleme` and `/forcescale` no longer exist in favor of the rework.
