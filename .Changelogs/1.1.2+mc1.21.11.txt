## 1.1.0+mc1.21.11 Changelog

### ***NEW CONTENT***
- No more "Moved too fast" warn.
  - Mainly done for elytra cannons
- Added `/afk` command
  - Utilizes Teams to give the player a `[AFK] ` name prefix                                        (TO FIX)
  - Makes the afk player invulnerable, but also player can not damage anything nor move when AFK    (MOVEMENT STOP NEEDS FINISHING)

### ***CHANGED CONTENT***
- Reworked `/scaleme` command, now named `/st-scale`
  - Normal players can still use `/st-scale <height_cm>`
  - Admins now have scaling tools:
    - `/st-scale force <player> <height_cm>` - Forces specific scale on a player.
    - `/st-scale unlock <player>` - Unlocks `Scale Lock` allowing the player to change their scale again.
    - `/st-scale reset <player>` - Resets the player's scale to the base scale and unlocks `Scale Lock`
    - `/st-scale reset-nounlock <player>` - Resets the player's scale to the base scale without unlocking the `Scale Lock`
  - Commands `/scaleme` and `/forcescale` no longer exist in favor of the rework.

### ***CONFIGURATION***
- The mod now has a config file!
