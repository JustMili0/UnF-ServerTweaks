# UnF Server Tweaks
Very cool 👍

<hr>

## Why?
I made this mod initially for my community Minecraft server, but after a while decided to put some more work into it and share it with the world.

<hr>

### How long will this be kept updated?
As long as the two Minecraft servers I moderate live. So pretty long I guess.

### Support for other mod loaders or/and older versions?
No. This mod is only for Fabric servers and will not receive updates for older Minecraft versions as the mod's development continues.
